<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>
With the rising use of marijuana in the hands of our younger generation, many ask if it is a healthy alternative for other medication in teenagers. It is easy to say no, however the purpose of this site is to bring together some verifiable and trustworthy information to help support the claim that marijuana has negative effects on the adolescent brain. The hopes of the website is to help guide those in need of good accurate, verifiable information that they can trust. 
</p>
<h3>Audience:</h3>
<p>
This website can have a large audience, however it is pointed towards teenagers and concerned parents. It can also be helpful for those looking to do research on this subject, or have an interest in this medical field. The website is intended for those who do not really know their way around the web. For those who find it difficult to differentiate what seems to be accurate information or not, this is the site for you. Teenagers are more likely to believe what is posted on social media, especially if it is coming from friends or celebrities who they trust. Those types of accounts are where a lot misinformation can be uploaded or shared through.</p> 
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>
This website uses verifiable sources as its platform to help support the claim about marijuana usage in adolescent teenagers. The main purpose is to help clarify the differences in good websites and the ones that have little to no valuable sources. Some social media websites like Facebook have taken responsibility in making sure fake news does not spread however, it is not always perfect.  There are pages within these sites that people can follow and continue to believe everything that these pages put out.  Websites may also not seem very accurate, as they will provide citations to other sources that seem very inaccurate or untrustworthy There is also a list of websites to stay away from as they may not provide any good substance of information that is verifiable. 
</p>
<h3>Criteria:</h3>
<p>
The verifiable websites need to meet criteria in order to make the list. Characteristics like, links to other trustworthy websites, links to journals, or statistical analysis of research data. Websites with &quot;may&quot; or &quot;could&quot; in title headlines, raise speculation on how accurate the information is in the website. Websites with mainly pictures, and no links to scientific studies raise a lot of red flags concerning how verifiable it is. Ones that are especially concerning, are websites that use a lot of stock photos instead of actual pictures depicting the research they are conducting. Most of these websites that do not seem trustworthy, have many online authors who do not seem to be relatively knowledgeable in the field they are reporting on. Even though they link to a lot of other medical websites that seem to be verifiable, the web pages still seem to be lacking some sort of substance. Alternatively, they post pictures and hyperlinks to other websites. The authors of these bad websites, seem to not write much about their own original thoughts and opinions. Most of the content is summaries of the links they provide to other websites. Another very suspicious type of information, comes from news outlets who primarily posts its contents on social, like that of Facebook. They provide very little sources, especially in their videos, where it is almost impossible to think that it would provide misinformation. Videos tend to give off more of a trustworthiness feeling to it, considering it took a lot of may hours to put together and publish a short edited video to the internet. Videos are everywhere now, not just Youtube or Facebook. Applications like Instagram, Snapchat, and even Twitter, provide news information that is very hard to verify. Due to the structure of how photos and videos are uploaded to these sites, there is very little room to include citations or sources.</p> 
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>
The goal of this website is to help and assist those looking for good information on the effects of marijuana on the teenage brain. Whether it be social media or accurate scientific journals, there is always room for questions about authenticity, accuracy, and most importantly verifiability. I have cut down many websites and separated the good from the bad. I included links to the websites, and the author&apos;s name to help reassure the credibility of the information the visitors of the website will be entering. Hopefully this website can help bring to light how important it is to stay aware of what type information is out there on the internet. It may seem trustworthy because of the site, or the celebrity sponsoring the information. Nonetheless, with the techniques presented in this document about recognizing different characteristics of what make a website or article verifiable and accurate, it can help pave the way in understanding what to believe.
